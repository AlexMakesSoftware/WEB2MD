Many thanks to Magnus Biderheimkindly who sent us some photos of his unboxing
the Nacken he received recently from us and commented:

“Did the unboxing yesterday and it all looks GREAT! Wow, what a fantastic
quality!  
This is going to be a wonderful build.  
I posted some pictures in social media yesterday.”

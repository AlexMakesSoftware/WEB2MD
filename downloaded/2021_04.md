# Month: April 2021

Posted on [April 26, 2021July 11, 2022](/new-launch/introducing-hms-artful/)

## [Introducing, ‘HMS Artful’](/new-launch/introducing-hms-artful/)

Our New kit HMS Artful ( Astute class ) submarine 1/72nd scale, is now
available for order. The kit contains the hull, deck and tower in glass fibre
and is 54 inches long with a 6 inch beam.

Front and Rear dive planes with stainless steel pivot rods fitted, top &
bottom rudders stainless steel pivot rods fitted Sonar array, set of Brass
bearings, arrangement drawing cloth flag,

We can also supply the pump jet and a dive system. All pictures supplied by
Gareth Hanak who is building first one now. There will be a set of accessories
available as well (bollards capstans etc).

The Astute class was introduced to replace the ageing Trafalgar hunter killer
fleet and was an upgraded version of the latter.

Launched in 2007, 97 meters long with a 11.3 meter long beam. The Astute has a
bit of an unlucky history. It ran aground off Skye in October 2010 and later
in April 2011 an officer was shot dead by one of his crew. There have been
other issues not officially reported. We have decided to call our Astute class
‘Artful’ purely because the Astute had such a run of bad luck.

### About this model

New kit available now!

A 1/72nd scale model of the modern British Astute class submarine. Astute is a
bad luck boat, having run aground twice (at least) and having had at a
commanding officer shot and killed on board, (so we call ours the Artful – not
that we’re superstitious or anything).

The kit includes detailed top and lower hull and tower in glass fibre front
and rear dive planes and top and bottom rudders all with cast in pivot rods
and supplied with bearings, sonar array and all deck fittings as well as the
pump jet and shaft.

We also supply an arrangement drawing, and we can now supply a complete set of
masts if required.

Everything you need to create your own, highly-accurate, highly detailed model
of the real thing.

Many thanks to Gareth Hanak in Edinburgh for these excellent photographs. All
our photos are sent in by happy customers, if you have one you’d like to share
with us, please get in touch.

### About this model

The Molch or Salamander was one man midget submarine carrying 2 external
torpedoes built by the Germans towards the end of WW2.It entered service in
1944 was produce in large number upwards of 350 plus. It was not very
successful as it was very difficult to dive and manoeuvre .The Clear cupola
was very vulnerable when attacked by allied fighter aircraft and in general it
was not one of the best midget designs. The kit includes detailed hull, deck,
tower, twin torpedoes, tower hatch with a clear dome, periscope and material
to produce the vertical fin and dive planes, plus a plan set. Additionally we
can supply a scale prop and shaft, torpedo fins, propellers and nose triggers
at extra cost.

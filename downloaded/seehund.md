### About this model

Our model of the Seehund exemplifies our attention to detail. The hull shows
every one of the plate lines and features the riveting detail around the
conning tower. This level of detail reflects the commitment of the designers
to produce the best and most accurate model of a Seehund available today –
regardless of cost. Kit includes the hull, dive planes, and brass fret, see
below.

Mark Strickland got in touch with us to send us a link to his video of his
Oberon build, which is about 15 years old and still going strong. How many
things can you buy these days that last that long and still run perfectly?

Nice video Mark.

If you have your own footage or photos to show us, please get in touch via the
contacts page. Weâ€™d love to hear from you.

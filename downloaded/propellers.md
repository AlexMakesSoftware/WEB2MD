This 5-bladed prop is true to scale for the Nacken model. It is about 4-1/2 in
(115 mm) in diameter.

The scale prop for the Upholder features seven blades, like the real thing.
These subs were rumored to be retrofitted with pump jets, but the status of
this is uncertain since their acquisition by the Canadian Defence Forces. It
is 3-3/4 in (95 mm) diameter.

Also candidates for pump jet retrofits, the original Trafalgar featured the
carefully shaped 7 bladed prop shown here. It is true to scale with a diameter
of about 3 in (76 mm).

measures some 1-3/4 in (95 mm) in diameter.

Contra-rotating prop pair for 1/9 scale torpedoes. Note that there are two
props, each with two blades; one is ‘left handed’ and the other ‘right
handed.’ They are about 1-1/2 in (38 mm) diameter. This is the prop used on
the Molch and Seehund torpedoes.

We also supply a selection of propellers and pump jet castings which are
available for our entire range of submarine models

### About this model

Our Type 23 model is a fine example of attention to detail. The hull shows all
the plate lines of the welded construction and the conning tower features all
the rivet head detail. This level of detail reflects the commitment of the
designers to produce the best and most accurate model of a Type 23 available
today – regardless of cost. Type 23 WWII German coastal submarine kit includes
the hull, deck, and tower fashioned from GRP. Polyurethane castings are
provided for the planes, plane guards, hatch cover, and rudder.

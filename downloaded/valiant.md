### About this model

The Valiant-class was the first fully British nuclear fleet submarine. There
were only two boats of the class, Valiant commissioned 1966 and Warspite the
following year. Both were built by Vickers at Barrow-in-Furness. The class was
based on Dreadnought but twenty feet (6 m) longer and 900 tons greater
submerged displacement (4900 tons). They also had a Paxman diesel-electric
generator for emergencies. In 1967, Valiant set a then RN record of sailing
12,000 miles (19,312 km) submerged in twenty-eight days, from Singapore to the
UK. HMS Valiant took part in the Falklands War, one of a number of nuclear
fleet submarines to do so. Warspite was de-commissioned in 1991, Valiant, in
1994.

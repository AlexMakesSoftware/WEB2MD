### About this model

Our model of the Upholder attempts to accurately depict the detail of the real
thing. This level of detail reflects the commitment of the designers to
produce the best and most accurate model of an Upholder available today –
regardless of cost. The hull, deck and tower are GRP moldings; the vanes and
rudder are polyurethane castings. Scale propeller and shaft are available as
an extra.

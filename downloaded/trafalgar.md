### About this model

The hallmark of the Trafalgar is the pumpjet propulsion system, available for
our model. Normally below water (even when the boat is surfaced) the pumpjet
surrounds a multi-blade impeller with a truncated cone (or lampshade) shaped
duct. This provides smooth and quiet propulsion over a wide range of speeds.
The kit includes the GRP moldings of the hull, deck, and tower, and
polyurethane castings of the vanes, rudder, and sonar.

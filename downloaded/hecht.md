### About this model

The Hecht or Pike is the third of our German midgets produced in the latter
stages of WW2. Only three of these boats where built so they did not progress
much further than the prototype stage. They could carry a large mine in the
detachable front section or a single torpedo. The craft was propelled only
with electric motors. Our Model is 1/9th scale at 46 inches long with a 5.5
inch beam. The basic kit includes Detailed Hull, Deck, tower, hatch, torpedo,
front dive planes, rudder, and rear stabilisers ,periscope, a set of drawings
and an illustrated CD of pictures we took when building the prototype.
Additionally we can supply a scale propeller and shaft, torpedo propellers,
fins, and nose trigger, together with 180 8BA nuts and threaded rod.

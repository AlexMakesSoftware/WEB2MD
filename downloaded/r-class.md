### About this model

The world’s first _Hunter Killer_ submarine, the ‘R Class’ had a 22-man crew (2 officers and 20 ratings) and was 163 feet long, by 16 ft (beam) and had a displacement of 420 tons. It had 6 x 18 inch torpedo tubes later replaced by 6 X 21 inch torpedoes tubes, an 8 cylinder engine with 480 HP and 2 electric motors (1200 HP) and could reach speeds of 9.5 knots on the surface and 15 submerged. The R class group of submarines were the fastest commissioned boats until the later days of WWII (1944) when the German Type 21 was commissioned – not bad for a small WWI Submarine! The submarine was first laid down by Vickers on the Tyne on December 1917, commissioned in 1918 and scrapped in 1929.

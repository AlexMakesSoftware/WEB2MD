# Month: May 2020

## [U441 and U953 flak tower.](/showcase/u441-and-u953-flak-tower/)

The pictures are of the basic tower shell and decks that we make. The tower
shell is 455mm long. This one was built by Ken Griffin in Florida. It was
designed to fit our existing OTW Type 7 boats so that owners can have a new
submarine just simply by fitting the new tower , with no need to alter the
central deck.

The tower will also be available as an addition to the existing OTW kit.

## [1/48th scale pump yet.](/uncategorized/1-48th-scale-pump-yet/)

CD case gives an idea of size.

Made for a 1/48th scale Astute submarine model somewhere in Quebec Canada but
also good for the 1/48th scale Sea wolf or any large submarine.

Mark Strickland got in touch with us to send us a link to his video of his
Oberon build, which is about 15 years old and still going strong. How many
things can you buy these days that last that long and still run perfectly?

Nice video Mark.

If you have your own footage or photos to show us, please get in touch via the
contacts page. We’d love to hear from you.

## [U441 and U953 flak tower.](/showcase/u441-and-u953-flak-tower/)

The pictures are of the basic tower shell and decks that we make. The tower
shell is 455mm long. This one was built by Ken Griffin in Florida. It was
designed to fit our existing OTW Type 7 boats so that owners can have a new
submarine just simply by fitting the new tower , with no need to alter the
central deck.

The tower will also be available as an addition to the existing OTW kit.
